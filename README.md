High Level Overview: In terms of a high level overview, there is a main message board and then there is a way to add a message.
When adding a message, it takes in a few different things and then adds the message to the main message board. The message board is structured as a form style where you can check the message off to try and remove the message, but I did not get to that functionality yet.

Components: The major component into play is the literall message that is added. Then within that message there is a title fiels, description, and there is a date. Those are all of the components that a message contains and are embedded inside of the message. There are also buttons on the pages but that is not completely a component.

I fulfill the requirements for the project because users are able to type a message and add it to the message board. Then, users are able to see the message at the top of the screen. However, one of the things that this does not support is the ability to view each other's messages. For that you would need to have a database and update the database with the message. I hope to add that functionality in the future.

Start: In order to start the application, cd into the folder and then assuming that you have all of the react dependencies, run ```npm start```. You may not need the react dependencies either, try running npm start while in the folder.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
